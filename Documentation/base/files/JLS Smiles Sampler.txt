JLS Smiles Sampler Font by Michael Adkins & James Stirling

"Have a nice day!" I can remember that motto and the smiley face from childhood. It was friendly, optimistic little image that became an icon. These days it has been updated and is a collection of emoticons used by cultures world wide. The smiley face can now be friendly, sad, happy, angry, etc. This collection is our fun expression of the smiley face. We've got smileys for emotions, seasons, some holidays, and just about all of the emotions. There are smileys for just about every occasion. We also created a smiley tribute to classic movie monsters. 

So, have a (insert your preference here) day!
